# Contoso Pizza EF Demo DB First

This project demonstrates a simple and clear implementation of Entity Framework Core 6 using the Database-First approach in a .NET 6 Web API. The fictional Contoso Pizza shop serves as the domain model, with entity classes generated by reverse-engineering an existing SQL Server database. The project is ideal for learning the basics of EF Core DB-First and clean API architecture in .NET 6.
